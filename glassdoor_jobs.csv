About Us

A few years ago, our intrepid team of nurses, doctors, developers, salespeople and data scientists came to a realization: if we can truly put the power of data and technology behind the clinical expertise of nurses and docs, we can transform the future of healthcare. Right now, we’re focused on bridging the silos that afflict the industry with inefficiency, waste, and friction, ultimately refocusing healthcare towards the patient, not the process.

We offer a Software as a Solution (SaaS) platform that connects previously disparate data from within an electronic medical record and transforms it into the type of clinical insight that can help providers determine appropriate care and reimbursement.

Additionally, this platform is used as a conduit to connect the provider to the payer, helping break down the information silos that result in denied claims, administrative burden, and strained relationships.

And to be clear: it’s working! We are expanding to help support our mission, our growth, and our clients. We’re looking for smart, savvy, spirited people like you to join the movement.

Materials Scientist - Hydrogen/Tritium Effects in Materials (Experienced),-1,"Posting Duration

This posting will be open for application submissions for a minimum of seven (7) calendar days, including the ‘posting date’. Sandia reserves the right to extend the posting date at any time.

What Your Job Will Be Like

We are seeking a R&D Materials Scientist to join the Hydrogen and Materials Science department!

We need a materials scientist to lead research on the transport and trapping of hydrogen isotopes – including tritium – in materials both in and out of radiation environments. Our organization works to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of gas-material interactions and how temperature and radiation might influence them.

On any given day, you may be called on to design and execute laboratory experiments that probe hydrogen and deuterium transport in materials, devise “capsule” experiments to study deuterium transport in research reactors, characterize how material properties and microstructure affect the diffusivity and trapping of hydrogen isotopes, develop new analytic methods and diagnostics to characterize transport and trapping processes, provide experimental data to inform the development of hydrogen transport models at various length scales, and communicate your findings through presentations, technical reports and high-impact journal articles.

The Hydrogen and Materials Science department is committed to attracting, retaining and cultivating an outstanding workforce representing a broad group of people and perspectives. We share this common vision by fostering mutual respect among staff, post-docs and interns from diverse backgrounds. Our team works together to accomplish extraordinary results!

Qualifications We Require

PhD in materials science, metallurgy, physics, nuclear engineering or a closely related field
Laboratory research experience that includes the interactions of hydrogen isotopes with materials
A record of first-author or co-authored scientific publications in the above areas within peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences
Ability to obtain and maintain a Department of Energy Q-level security clearance
Qualifications We Desire

Laboratory experience characterizing the kinetics of hydrogen isotopes in materials using techniques such as thermal desorption spectroscopy, permeation studies, optical and electron microscopy/spectroscopy, and other methods
Experience with instrument design for materials characterization, including safety planning
Experience with hydrogen isotope experiments in research energy reactors
Knowledge on how hydrogen isotopes interact with material microstructures
Deep understanding of physical and mechanical metallurgy
About Our Team

We are the Hydrogen and Materials Science team! We provide expertise to both Sandia and the Nation on the interaction of hydrogen (and its isotopes) with all types of materials. We perform scientific and engineering research to develop fundamental understanding on the aging of materials in gaseous environments, including hydrogen, and applies this understanding to determine its effects on the performance and reliability of materials relevant to Sandia’s nuclear weapons and energy missions. Our work covers a broad range of areas, including analyzing hydrogen’s long-term impact on materials and maintaining and enhancing nationally recognized core and enabling capabilities in hydrogen isotope science.

About Us
Presbyterian Healthcare Services is a locally owned, not-for-profit healthcare system of nine hospitals, a statewide health plan and a growing multi-specialty medical group. Founded in New Mexico in 1908, it is the state's largest private employer with approximately 11,000 employees.

Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico
New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great.

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

New Mexico offers endless recreational opportunities to explore, and enjoy an active lifestyle. Venture off the beaten path, challenge your body in the elements, or open yourself up to the expansive sky. From hiking, golfing and biking to skiing, snowboarding and boating, it's all available among our beautiful wonders of the west.

Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Architecture and design of highly available/scalable distributed systems.
